# Decimation-Simulation
This Java program simulates the decimation of a population. The user enters the size of a population, and a percentage to use for decimation.

From Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimation_(punishment)):

In the military of ancient Rome, decimation was a form of military discipline in which every
tenth man in a group was executed by members of his cohort.
...
A cohort (roughly 480 soldiers) selected for punishment by decimation was divided into groups
of ten. Each group drew lots, and the soldier on whom the lot of the shortest straw fell was
executed by his nine comrades, often by stoning, clubbing, or stabbing.

This program that will simulate the decimation of a population.
In our simulation, we will let the user decide the amount
to reduce the population by.

You will need to download the Java ZIP file and open it using a Java IDE such as eclipse.
